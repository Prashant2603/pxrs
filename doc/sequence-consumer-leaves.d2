Consumer1 -> Consumer1: stop() — stops own threads, commits checkpoints

Consumer1 -> Coordinator: deregister(this)
Coordinator -> Store: releaseAllPartitions(C1)
Coordinator -> Store: deregisterConsumer(C1)

  label: "Rebalance remaining consumers"
  Coordinator -> Store: rebalance() — assigns C1's partitions to C2
}

  Store -> Coordinator: checkpoints for {0,1,2,3}
  Coordinator -> Consumer2: onPartitionsAssigned({0:ckpt, 1:ckpt, 2:ckpt, 3:ckpt})
  Consumer2 -> Consumer2: start threads for 0,1,2,3 from saved checkpoints
